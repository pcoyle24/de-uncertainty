## Codes to run
All Matlab files in this folder are self contained. They all produce a different version of the Risk Adjusted Fisher Relation (RAFR) for what is found in the paper.
These codes solve for the RAFR analytically, as described in Appendix A.

The codes are:  
- iid_RAFR_cPHI_x.m and iid_RAFR_cPHI_x_cPItarg.m reproduce figures 2-4 for x in {l (low),m (medium),h (high)}.
- iid_RAFR_cPHI_lb.m and iid_RAFR_cPHI_lb.m reproduce figure 11, which detail the infinitely many equilibria.
