# ReadMe Documentation for "Deflationary Equilibrium Under Uncertainty" by Coyle, Nakata, and Schmidt.

Codes to replicate the figures are found in *\Draft\Figs*. There are three subfolders:
1. *ar1* - contains code files related to the model with an AR(1) demand shock specification
   - contains subfolder for codes that use an n-state Rouwenhorst discritization of demand shock with inflation target.
2. *iid* - contains code files related to the model with an I.I.D. demand shock specification
   - contains subfolder for codes that use a 3-state I.I.D. discritization of demand shock.
3. *Final* - contains final figures that are published in the paper. All codes that produce figures are by default saved in this folder.
